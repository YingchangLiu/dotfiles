# kelen's dotfiles

**This repository is designed to sync and restore my working environment, including: setting up bash/zsh with required environment variables, linking tool configs (mainly about scientific calculations and seismic waveform inversion), restoring the window manager with backup options, and managing additional resources such as package management backups, symbol fonts, and wallpapers. I follow XDG standards for linking and provide an install script. Your existing dotfiles are backed up in a 'bak' folder for safety.**

## How to use
***Warning***: A word of caution, I am actively working with **Debian** and **Gentoo**. Do not blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

Run this to install:
```
git clone https://github.com/yingchangliu/dotfiles.git --recurse-submodules --depth=1
cd ~/dotfiles
./install
```
***Note***: You may need to modify  [`shellrc/zshplugin.zsh`](./shellrc/zshplugin.zsh) to fit your distribution. Package managers put their plugins in different directories.

Typing `uninstall` will restore your original settings.
```
sh ./install uninstall
```
Feel free to change the dotfiles as you see fit.
